# Description and Motivation

This is a component library for my simple icon animations. It is published through GitHub Packages https://github.com/arth-shukla/my-icons/packages/1583093.

Since I will likely use these components across multiple projects, I made a library so I don't have to port the same components to each new project.

# Features

1. Supports computer, mobile, and tablet web interfaces through webkit
2. Written in Typescript
    - Prop typing allows for easier debugging in projects
    - Components usable in both Typescript and standard React projects
3. Accessible
    - The components themselves support keyboard control and aria tags are added where appropriate.
    - Additional acessibility options (e.g. `aria-label`s) must be passed as props.
4. Customizable
    - Additional props (ids, classNames, etc) can be passed into the component to override default styling.
